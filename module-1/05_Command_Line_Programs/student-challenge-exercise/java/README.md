## Challenge - Calculate Primes

### Requirements

* Ask the user how many prime numbers you should calculate
* Create an array to store you prime numbers (it should be the right size based on the users input)
* Calculate enough prime numbers to fill the array
* Display all of your calculated prime numbers to the screen (one number per line)
* All user input should be in its own method
* All business logic should be in its own method
* All user output (println) should be in its own method

In this challenge problem, I am not only interested in the fact that you can solve the logical problem. But I am interested in how your code is organized. 

* How easy is it to read
* Are the variable names meaningful
* Are the function names meaningful

I.E. Could someone understand what the program does by reading the variable and function names without having to disect the logic of your code? (the if statements and loops)

I am far less concerned that you get the fewest lines of code possible than I am that the code has meaning and is easy to maintain.
