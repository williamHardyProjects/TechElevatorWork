# Review and Holiday Break
Use this time over the next 2 weeks to let your brain organize and solidify the concepts that we have been learning. This is a perfect time to catch up on any concepts that you are struggling with.

When we get back in January, we will be moving forward with new concepts quickly.

## Things to do over the break
Make sure that you face the concepts that are the most challenging for you. If you are struggling with Arrays, do exercises and drills with Arrays until you are comfortable.

You will want to be confident in these areas
- if-else statements
- for and foreach loops
- Arrays, Lists and Maps
- Building Classes
- Class inheritance structures (Look at the Bank homework and todays Card Game example)

### Review Difficult Concepts
- Re-work the exercises
- Re-submit exercises for re-grading
- Do the **Extra Exercises** for more practice
- Do the **Assessments** to solidify building classes
- Go to [CodingBat.com](https://codingbat.com/java) for additional exercises and drills
- Sign up for a [CodeWars.com](https://www.codewars.com) account and do java challenges
- Other sites [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

### Start Building a Side Project
Build a simple command line user interface. Here are a few ideas:

- 20 Questions game 
- Magic 8 Ball
- Improve the Card Game solution
- Extend the Card Game to create card versions for Phase 10, or Uno
