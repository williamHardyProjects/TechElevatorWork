-- Write queries to return the following:
-- Make the following changes in the "world" database.

-- 1. Add Superman's hometown, Smallville, Kansas to the city table. The 
-- countrycode is 'USA', and population of 45001. (Yes, I looked it up on 
-- Wikipedia.)

-- 2. Add Kryptonese to the countrylanguage table. Kryptonese is spoken by 0.0001
-- percentage of the 'USA' population.

-- 3. After heated debate, "Kryptonese" was renamed to "Krypto-babble", change 
-- the appropriate record accordingly.

-- 4. Set the US captial to Smallville, Kansas in the country table.

-- 5. Delete Smallville, Kansas from the city table. (Did it succeed? Why?)

-- 6. Return the US captial to Washington.

-- 7. Delete Smallville, Kansas from the city table. (Did it succeed? Why?)

-- 8. Reverse the "is the official language" setting for all languages where the
-- country's year of independence is within the range of 1800 and 1972 
-- (exclusive).
