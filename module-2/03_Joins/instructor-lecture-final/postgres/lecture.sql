-- Let's find out who made payment 16666:

-- Ok, that gives us a customer_id, but not the name. We can use the customer_id to get the name FROM the customer table
SELECT *
FROM payment AS p

-- We can see that the * pulls back everything from both tables. We just want everything from payment and then the first and last name of the customer:
SELECT p.*

        , c.last_name
FROM payment AS p
INNER JOIN customer AS c

-- ********* LEFT JOIN ***********

-- (There aren't any great examples of left joins in the "dvdstore" database, so the following queries are for the "world" database)

-- A Left join, selects all records from the "left" table and matches them with records from the "right" table if a matching record exists.

-- Let's display a list of all countries and their capitals, if they have some.
SELECT c.name
        , c.capital
        , city.name
FROM country AS c
INNER JOIN city
        ON c.capital = city.id;


-- Only 232 rows
-- But we're missing entries:

-- There are 239 countries. So how do we show them all even if they don’t have a capital?
-- That’s because if the rows don’t exist in both tables, we won’t show any information for it. If we want to show data FROM the left side table everytime, we can use a different join:
SELECT c.name
        , c.capital
        , city.name
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN city
        ON c.capital = city.id;
        
SELECT c.name
        , c.capital
        , city.name
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN city
        ON c.capital = city.id
WHERE city.name IS NULL;
